            <h3>Coding Theory Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Collection of projects on algebraic coding theory. Topics include Reed-Solomon, Goppa, Golay, Convolutional, and Hamming codes, as well as mathemtaical frameworks.</p>

            <h3>Computational Geometry Portfolio and Efficient Database Querying Project</h3>
            <p>A series of computation geometry projects on Convex Hull algorithms, pathfinding algorithms, and shape/intersections methods, and more using Python. Personal capstone project included implementing n-dimensional Orthogonal Range Querying data structure, a way of querying a database in O(log^(d-1) n + k) time where d is the number of dimensions, n the number of items in the database, and k the number of items returned. This is achieved using a recursive-binary-tree-like data structure with O(n log^(d-1) n) space complexity. Currently working on creating an algorithm to recursively rebalance the data structure when items are added or removed.</p>

            <h3>UVA CIO Misconduct Web Application</h3>
            <p>Python web application built on top of Django MVC Framework. Allows existing or anonymous users to upload new reports or to view and delete their past ones. Also allows specified "admin" accounts to view all reports, offer feedback and status reports, and publish reports to a publicly available page. Implements Google User Login for authentication, and Amazon S3 storage to store uploaded reports.</p>

            <h3>Course Reviews Application</h3>
            <p>Java-based Course Review Application implementing MVC architecture. Allows users to create local account, create new classes and reviews, search existing classes by name/information, view reviews and ratings for a specified course, and view and delete their past reviews. Hibernate and SQLite were used for data persistence, and JavaFX was used for UI/UX design. </p>

            <h3>GPU-Logger Module for MURS Radio</h3>
            <p>Currently undertaking undergraduate capstone project of creating a radio accessory to add GPS logging functionality for a local biking group. GPS coordinates will be transmitted after end of audio transmission and automatically at regular intervals, and be able to be decoded by a sotware application to display the last-known locations of every transmitter in the network. Includes software, embedded, PCB and communication systems design. </p>
