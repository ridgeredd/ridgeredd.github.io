            <h3>Course Reviews Application</h3>
            <p>Java-based Course Review Application implementing MVC architecture. Allows users to create local account, create new classes and reviews, search existing classes by name/information, view reviews and ratings for a specified course, and view and delete their past reviews. Hibernate and SQLite were used for data persistence, and JavaFX was used for UI/UX design. </p>

            <h3>UVA CIO Misconduct Web Application</h3>
            <p>Python web application built on top of Django MVC Framework. Allows existing or anonymous users to upload new reports or to view and delete their past ones. Also allows specified "admin" accounts to view all reports, offer feedback and status reports, and publish reports to a publicly available page. Implements Google User Login for authentication, and Amazon S3 storage to store uploaded reports. UI/UX design still in progress.</p>

            <h3>Computational Geometry Portfolio and Efficient Database Querying Project</h3>
            <p>A series of computation geometry projects on Convex Hull Algorithms, Shortest Path Algorithms, etc using pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and various other libraries. Personal capstone project included implementing n-dimensional Orthogonal Range Querying, a way of querying a database in O(log^(d-1) n + k) time where d is the number of dimensions, n the number of items in the database, and k the number of items returned. This is achieved using a recursive-binary-tree-like data structure with O(n log^(d-1) n) space complexity. Currently working on creating an algorithm to recursively rebalance the data structure when items are added or removed.</p>
